# TestSupport
Demo application for the implementation of the Official Android Test Support library

Examples for the implementation and use of the [Android Test Support Library](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support) which
includes support for running JUnit tests inside of an Android application without the need for installing the test apk on a device/emulator. Also 
included in the support library is an updated Espresso2 implementation, a framework for running automated UI testing.
